# Open-Now
Open-Now
Displays Text showing if you are open or closed

Javascript created to populate a div with flashing text stating if the company is open or closed. Text converts to static for mobile devices showing opening hours.

I have also edited the style so the colour of the header changes to show the poing of change for the javascript element. To edit the days and hours open or closed, change the values in the Javascript.js file

The example page is built using Foundation 5 framework and includes .css files and an Image.
